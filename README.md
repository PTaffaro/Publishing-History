#### Pies and Pronunciation

Whether you pronounce it PEE-CAN or puh-KHAN, the pecan has a history richer and more complex than its popularity as the basis for the Thanksgiving pie might suggest. As historian James McWilliams has argued, the pecan (*Carya illinoinensis*) has been an important food source for people in the Americas for thousands of years due to its high nutritional value and abundance. As he also points out, however, there has been a change in our relationship to the pecan in recent years: for most of history, humans relied on wild pecans for food, since wild pecan populations were unusually resilient and capable of maintaining themselves. In other words, humans adapted to the rhythms and life cycles of the pecan. Beginning in the late nineteenth century, however, pecan cultivation ramped up as humans began to seek to control pecan production and increase output. This trend has resulted in numerous potential threats to the pecan, including loss of genetic diversity and potential extinction. Even so, Indigenous botanists like Robin Wall Kimmerer have pointed to a solution. While the future of the pecan may appear grim, the answer to the problem of its possible disappearance lies within the deep history of its relationship with humans. If we could return to a more reciprocal, mutually beneficial relationship with pecans, both we and pecans could flourish.

#### Native American Discovery and Use
Native Americans were the first to come into contact with the pecan, which they named _pakan_,[^Ref 2] some 30,000–12,000 years ago. The pecan quickly became a popular foodstuff due to its abundance, resilience, and nutritious components, which included significant amounts of protein, fiber, and fat.[^Ref 3] Foraging pecans was easy: gatherers would simply wait for the nuts to fall or throw a stick at the tree to knock them down.[^Ref 4] Simple tools like rocks were used to crack open the shell. The nuts were also boiled and stored for later use as they lasted for long periods of time. The nut could be eaten in many different forms and various ways, including as a powder added to breads, meats, porridges, and even alcoholic beverages.

As an essential component of Native American diets, the pecan greatly influenced migration patterns due to its specific fruiting and [masting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mast_seeding) patterns.[^Ref 5] Nations like the Comanche, Caddo, and Kickapoo not only based their migration patterns on the pecan's masting schedule but also may have settled where they did because of their desire to be close to abundant pecan groves.[^Ref 6] They did this despite pecan’s propensity for alternate masting: depending on the year, some groves would fruit while others would not.[^Ref 7] Because of the sheer abundance of nuts that the trees produced, however, Native Americans fit their migration patterns around the pecans’ unusual schedule, as “The pecan trees, to an extent, told them where to go. Indians, fully sold on the nut’s worth, followed.”[^Ref 8] The pecan also became a staple in Native American trade, as different groups would travel with baskets of pecans to exchange with other Native American groups.[^Ref 9] Indeed, there is evidence suggesting that Native Americans helped pecan trees spread and flourish since they carried pecans when they migrated and planted them in new locations. And so, even as pecans helped them, they helped the pecans. As Potawatami botanist Robin Wall Kimmerer has written about this relationship, “Our taking returns benefits to them in the circle of life making life, the chain of reciprocity.”[^Ref 10] While Indigenous relations with pecans and pecan trees were largely reciprocal, this relationship changed with the arrival of new groups to the Americas.
